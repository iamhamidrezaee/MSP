# Microsoft Stocks Project

## Description: 
A machine learning model trained to predict Microsoft's stock price

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the stock prices of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) using historical stock data. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, including XGBoost and time series analysis, the model aims to provide accurate forecasts for future stock prices.

## Key Features:

Utilizes historical daily stock data of Microsoft (MSFT) from 1986 to 2023.

Implements XGBoost regression to build a robust predictive model.

Includes time series analysis to capture trends and seasonality in the stock prices.

Performs hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for optimal model performance.

Provides interactive Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model analysis.

Applies feature engineering for improving the model performance and prediction accuracy. 

Explains every part of the project with great detail and description

## Usage:

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

Access the Jupyter notebooks to explore the data and understand the model construction.

Use the trained model to predict Microsoft stock prices for future dates.

Evaluate the model's performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2).

Feel free to contribute, raise issues, or suggest improvements to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the stock price predictions. 
Let's work together to make better investment decisions with data-driven insights, while writing accurate, clear, and understandable code.
